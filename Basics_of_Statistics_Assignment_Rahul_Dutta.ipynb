        "1. **Symmetry**:  \n",

        "   - Mean = Median = Mode.  \n",

        "2. **Bell-Shaped Curve**:  \n",
        "   - The distribution forms a smooth, bell-shaped curve.  \n",

        "   - The shape and spread of the curve depend on the mean (\\(\\mu\\)) and standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)).  \n",
